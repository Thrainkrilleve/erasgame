2d indie style
Open World Sandbox
Earth like terrain
Chunk generation system (like minecraft, 20x20 grid) 32x32 pixel item - 400 tiles per chunk, 9-12 chunck around the character, depending on character location, saves data into a .ini file, loaded into a data structure, but is reloaded on character movement, and generated only once, but needs to be optimized to reduce CPU load. Can pregenerate on game load around character position.

World interaction, rigid body assets, such as chopping a tree down and it falling down at certain points and amount of hits.
